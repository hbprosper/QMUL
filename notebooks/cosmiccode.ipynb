    "# Code: Cosmological Models to Type 1a Supernova Data\n",
    " __Created__:  2019 Based on work by undergraduate Kyle Kehrer, supervised by Harrison B. Prosper\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A __[Type Ia supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova)__ is thought to be the thermonuclear detonation of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf whose mass has reached the __[Chandrasekhar limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit)__ of about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Beyond that mass limit, the \"quantum pressure\" of the electrons due to the Pauli exclusion principle is insufficient to keep the white dwarf stable. The favored model is a binary system in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen from its red giant partner until the white dwarf reaches the point of thermonuclear instability. The fact that roughly the same mass explodes each time, namely 1.4 solar masses, which yields an immensely luminous event, makes Type 1a supernovae excellent markers for measuring cosmological distances. While there is some variation in the luminosity of these explosions, it turns out that through a simple empirical procedure it is possible to convert these explosions into standard candles. Given a standard candle, that is, a system of known luminosity and therefore known intrinsic brightness, and given the system's apparent brightness, the inverse square law can be used to infer the distance to the system. If we can determine the distance and redshift $z = (\\lambda_o - \\lambda_e)/ \\lambda_e$ for many Type 1a supernovae, we can use these data to infer the parameters of cosmological models. The observed wavelength $\\lambda_o$ is readily measured, while the emitted wavelength $\\lambda_e$, that is, the wavelength of the light emitted by the supernova in its rest frame, can be inferred by identifying the known spectral lines of the excited atoms and molecules.\n",

    "Current cosmological models of the universe are based on the __1st Friedmann equation__,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho(a) - \\frac{K c^2}{a^2} + \\frac{\\Lambda c^2}{3},\n",

    "and the __Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker__ (FLRW) metric\n",

    "    ds^2 = (c dt)^2 - a^2(t)\\left[ \\frac{dr^2}{1 - Kr^2} + r^2 (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\phi^2) \\right],\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $a(t)$ is a dimensionless function, called the __scale factor__, that models how __proper distances__ change with cosmic time $t$. The proper distance is the spacetime separation between *simultaneous* events. By convention, the scale factor is normalized so that $a(t_0) = 1$ at the present epoch $t_0$, which is the elapsed time since the Big Bang, defined by $a(0) = 0$. $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ the speed of light in vacuum, $\\dot{a} \\equiv da/dt$, and $\\rho c^2$ is the density of all forms of energy excluding that due to the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. The constant $K$, which has units of inverse area, is the global curvature of space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Care must be exercised in interpreting the symbols of any metric. For example, the radial coordinate $r$ is not the proper distance between the center of the sphere at $r = 0$ and the sphere! The operational meaning of the radial coordinate $r$ is simply $r = \\sqrt{A \\, / \\, (4\\pi)}$, where $A$ is the proper area of the sphere centered at $r = 0$, *today*. The proper distance between any two nearby galaxies today, when by choice $a(t_0) = 1$, is the square root of the term in square brackets in the FLRW metric. That distance, $d\\chi$, is called the __comoving distance__. It is comoving because the coordinate grid that defines it expands with the universe. Therefore, if a galaxy is stationary with respect to this expanding grid, its comoving coordinates (relative to some origin) do not change. By choice, comoving distances match proper distances today; at any other time $t$, the proper distance between any two galaxies that are not necessarily nearby is given by \n",

    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of galaxies relative to the expanding comoving grid, the so-called perculiar motion, is small (roughly on the order of 200 km/s) compared with the speed of light. Therefore, on the scale of millions of years, it is a very good approximation to presume that the same time $t$ since the Big Bang can be assigned to all galaxies, that is, that all galaxies share the same surfaces of simultaneity. This is just as well, because it makes it possible to describe the evolution of the universe in a way that is not specific to our particular circumstance. Ironically, however, this is a highly non-relativistic way to conceptual spacetime. In principle, spacetime is to be regarded as a completed 4-dimensional \"thing\" that doesn't evolve; spacetime just is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, the comoving distance between any two galaxies can be oriented to lie along the radial direction, for which $d\\theta = d\\phi = 0$. Since, by definition, the comoving distance is the proper distance between galaxies today, it follows that \n",

    "## Cosmological Models\n",
    "For our purposes, a cosmological model is a mathematical description of how the dimensionless density $\\Omega(a)$ in the model universe evolves with the scale factor $a$ together with dependence of the scale factor on the universal time $t$, obtained by solving the (1st) Friedmann equation $\\dot{a} = H_0 a \\sqrt{\\Omega(a)}.$\n",

    "In this tutorial, we consider two cosmological models, the standard model of cosmology $\\Lambda\\textrm{CDM}$ in which on every surface of simultanaeity (aka 3D space!) the model universe is filled with a homogeneous distribution of massless particles, a pressureless dust of galaxies, and a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. The second model (which I cooked up during an introductory class I taught on modern physics) is a phantom energy model in which the validity of the Friedmann equation is assumed. \n",

    "We need to express the comoving distance $\\chi$ in terms of the parameters of the cosmological model. \n",
    "To that end, consider the worldline of a photon in spacetime. Massless particles travel on null geodesics, defined by $ds = 0$, for which $c dt = a(t) d\\chi$. The latter expression is deceptively simple. The left-hand side states that a photon travels a distance $c dt$ from some event $A(t)$ to a *non-simultaneous* event $B(t + dt)$. But on the right-hand side, the comoving distance $d\\chi$ between *simultaneous* events $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ is scaled by the factor $a(t)$ to give the proper distance $a(t) d\\chi$ between these events. The correspondence between the distance traveled by light and the proper distance permits the use of the worldline of a photon as a standard ruler whose measure, namely the distance traveled by light in the time interval $(t, t + dt)$, can be scaled by $1/a(t)$ to yield an expression for the comoving distance $d\\chi = c dt \\, / \\, a(t)$ that depends on the cosmological model.
